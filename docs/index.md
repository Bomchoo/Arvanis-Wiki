# Welcome to the Echoes of the Ancients

## Welcome to the World of Terralon

Welcome, intrepid adventurers, to the realm of Terralon—a land brimming with magic, mystery, and the echoes of ancient civilizations. Here in the continent of Galdor, you will embark on a journey across diverse terrains, from the lush Emerald Valley to the mysterious Mystwood, and beyond to the treacherous waters surrounding the Sapphire Isles.

## Explore the Rich Tapestry of Galdor

In this campaign, you will explore a world where the present is perpetually intertwined with the past. The kingdoms and empires of Galdor have risen upon the foundations of forgotten epochs, and whispers of lost technologies and magic resonate through the ruins scattered across the landscape. As adventurers, you will engage with cultures that are as varied as the geography they inhabit, each with their own customs, conflicts, and secrets.

### Key Places to Visit

- **Emerald Valley**: Known for its verdant landscapes and fertile plains, it is a place of peace and agriculture, but ancient secrets lie buried beneath its soils.
- **Mystwood**: A dense and fog-laden forest where the trees are said to be as old as Terralon itself. The wood hides creatures of old magic and forgotten shrines.
- **The Sapphire Isles**: A cluster of islands surrounded by deep blue seas and notorious for their pirate activity as well as ancient maritime ruins.
- **Doranth**: This bustling market city is where your journey starts. Doranth is known for its rich history and as a melting pot of cultures and commerce.
- **The Sunken Peaks**: Mysterious mountain ranges whose tops are wreathed in clouds and are said to house the entrances to underground realms.

You will encounter enigmatic characters, fearsome creatures, and puzzles that require more than just muscle to solve. Your actions will influence the world around you, shaping the future of Galdor as you delve into its deepest mysteries.

## Your Quest Begins

Your quest will begin in the vibrant market of Doranth, where chance—or perhaps fate—will introduce you to Ivor, a scholar whose discovery of an ancient artifact could unravel the history of the world itself. This artifact, and the secrets it holds, may lead you to other remnants of a long-lost civilization that predates even the oldest known records of Terralon. But be warned, such treasures rarely lie unguarded or uncontested.
