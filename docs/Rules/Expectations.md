### Session Cancelations

!!! tip "Advance notice, is the best notice"

    Letting the Dungeon Master (DM) and fellow players know in advance if you can't make a session is important for several reasons. Dungeons & Dragons is a collaborative experience that often involves detailed preparation by the DM and coordinated efforts among players. When you communicate your availability early, it allows the DM to tailor scenarios and storylines appropriately, ensuring that each session is engaging and well-organized. It also respects the time and efforts of your fellow players, who often rearrange their personal schedules to participate. While last-minute cancellations are sometimes unavoidable—life can indeed be unpredictable—regular communication and advance notice help maintain the integrity of the game and ensure that everyone has a positive and immersive experience. This kind of consideration and reliability strengthen the group dynamic and make the adventure enjoyable for everyone involved.
