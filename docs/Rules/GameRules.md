### Meta-Gaming

!!! warning "Please don't do this"

    **Metagaming in the context of role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons refers to when a player uses knowledge that their character would not realistically have to influence their decisions during gameplay. This often involves applying real-world information or player-level data to situations within the game, breaking the immersive experience of the game and operating outside the game's internal logic and story.**

    **For example, if a player's character comes across a creature for the first time and the character has no prior knowledge of such a creature, but the player uses their own knowledge from having read the game's monster manual to exploit the creature's weaknesses, that would be considered metagaming. Similarly, if a player acts on information their character hasn't learned in the story, such as overhearing a conversation between the Dungeon Master and another player about a hidden trap, and then avoids the trap, it is also metagaming.**

    **Metagaming can diminish the role-playing aspect of the game, as it encourages players to make decisions based on external considerations rather than staying true to their characters' perspectives and the in-game scenario. It can also lead to unfair advantages and reduce the overall enjoyment and challenge of the game for everyone involved.**
