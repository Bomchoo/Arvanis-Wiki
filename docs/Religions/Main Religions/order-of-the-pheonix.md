## Description
The Covenant of the Phoenix worships Kord, not only as the god of strength and warfare but also as a symbol of survival and rebirth—much like the phoenix, which is revered as a sacred creature within this faith. This religion appeals to humans with their resilience and adaptability, tieflings with their fiery nature and struggle for acceptance, and dragonborn with their innate strength and draconic heritage.

## Temples and Practices
Temples to Kord under the Covenant of the Phoenix are fortified strongholds, often located in strategic positions near or within cities frequently troubled by war or conflict. These temples serve as both sanctuaries and training grounds, where followers learn the arts of war and personal fortitude.

Priests, known as Phoenix Ascendants, wear vestments adorned with phoenix imagery and are often seen both as spiritual leaders and as commanders in times of war. They preach about the purifying power of conflict and the importance of rising anew from the adversities of life—stronger and wiser.

## Festivals and Rites
The most significant festival is the Day of Ashes, a celebration during which effigies of the phoenix are burned to symbolize falling in battle and rising again stronger. Participants also engage in competitive games and martial displays, emphasizing self-improvement and communal support.

## Cultural Impact
The Covenant of the Phoenix teaches that strength comes from overcoming personal and external battles, a philosophy that resonates deeply with humans, tieflings, and dragonborn alike. This shared belief helps to bridge cultural and racial divides among these races, fostering a sense of unity and mutual respect based on the ideals of resilience and rebirth.
