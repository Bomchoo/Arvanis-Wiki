# Discord Setup Guide for D&D Sessions

Welcome, Players!

For our Dungeons & Dragons sessions, we will be utilizing Discord for voice communications. If you are unfamiliar with Discord, here's a simple guide to get you started and ready for our game nights.

## Step 1: Download and Install Discord

1. Navigate to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/).
2. Select "Download for Windows" or the appropriate version for your device (Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android are also supported).
3. Once downloaded, execute the installer file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Discord.

## Step 2: Create a Discord Account

1. Launch Discord.
2. Upon opening, you'll have the option to log in or create a new account. Click on “Register” to create a new account.
3. Provide your email address, a username, password, and your date of birth, then click "Continue".
4. A verification link will be sent to your email. Click this link to verify your account.

## Step 3: Join Our Discord Server

1. I will send you an invite link to our server. Click on this link.
2. If not already logged in, the link will prompt you to log into Discord using the account you just created.
3. After logging in, you will be prompted to join the server. Click "Join".

## Step 4: Configure Your Audio Settings

1. Click the gear icon next to your username at the bottom left of the Discord interface to open "User Settings".
2. Under "App Settings", select "Voice & Video".
3. Select your preferred Input Device (microphone) and Output Device (speakers or headphones).
4. Utilize the "Mic Test" feature to test and adjust your microphone's input volume.
5. Ensure "Voice Activity" is enabled for automatic voice detection or select "Push to Talk" if you prefer to press a key to activate your microphone.

## Step 5: Join a Voice Channel

1. Within our server, you'll see a list of text and voice channels on the left side. Voice channels are indicated by a speaker icon.
2. Click on the voice channel designated for our game sessions to join. You should now be able to hear and communicate with other players in the channel.

## Step 6: Using Discord During Sessions

- Simply talk into your microphone to speak if you've enabled "Voice Activity". If using "Push to Talk", hold down the assigned key while you speak.
- Adjust the volume for individual users by right-clicking on their name and moving the "User Volume" slider.
- If you encounter any technical issues, use the server's text channels to ask for help or to communicate while troubleshooting.

You're now fully set up to use Discord for our D&D sessions. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, feel free to ask.
