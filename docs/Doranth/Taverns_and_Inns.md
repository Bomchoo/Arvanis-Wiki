## Well known Taverns and Inns around Doranth

!!! quote "When you just want a bed and some food"

    "Ah, my friends, in the whirlwind of our quests and conquests, amidst the clashing swords and arcane blasts, 'tis oft forgotten that the simplest of pleasures bring the deepest comfort. Mark my words: on a cold night, under the shadow of looming mountains or within the haunted depths of ancient forests, what the soul truly yearns for is not gold nor glory, but a hearty meal to warm the belly and a soft bed to rest the weary bones."

    — Sir Cedric Thornwood, Knight of the Autumn Vale

It's rumored that the rooms are blessed with a subtle charm to ensure peaceful and loving dreams, attracting not only lovers but also diplomats seeking amity in negotiations.*

2. **The Sweet Bear**
   *Founded by a retired ranger known only as Eldwin the Bear, this inn was named after his loyal companion, a large bear named Sweetpea who saved Eldwin during numerous forest adventures. The inn is decorated with woodland motifs and bearskin rugs. It’s popular among adventurers and travelers seeking stories of the wild.*

3. **The Hag's Goat**

Today, it is renowned for its extravagant decor and opulent feasts, attracting the wealthy and the curious alike.*

### Small Inns

The inn is a sturdy, stone-built structure filled with war memorabilia, and is a favored spot for veterans and current soldiers seeking a touch of home and a listening ear.*

2. **The Grating Piglet**
   *Originally a failed alchemist’s shop, the building was purchased by a jovial halfling couple who transformed it into an inn. The name 'Grating Piglet' refers to the squeaky sign that swings outside, shaped like a small pig. Known for its hearty meals and home-brewed ales, it’s a cozy place for common folk and travelers looking for warmth and laughter.*
