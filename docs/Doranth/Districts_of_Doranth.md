## Housing in Non-Residential Districts

While most of the city's residential life is concentrated in specific districts like South Slums, North Hills, and Southfield, there are also residential properties located within primarily non-residential areas. These properties are typically situated in commercial, industrial, or mixed-use districts and come with specific ownership and living conditions.

### Eligibility for Housing in Non-Residential Districts

- **Nobility and High Status Individuals**: Members of the nobility or those holding significant social or political status have the privilege to choose their residence across the city. Their status often grants them access to properties that offer strategic advantages, such as proximity to the city's power centers or exclusive, high-security areas.
- **Special Permissions**: There are cases where individuals can obtain the right to live in non-residential districts through special permissions granted by the governor or the council of representatives. Such permissions are typically awarded based on contributions to the city, special circumstances, or through political and social connections.

### Implications and Considerations
Living in non-residential districts provides certain advantages, such as direct access to commercial activities and a closer connection to the city's economic and cultural hubs. However, these areas might also experience higher levels of noise, traffic, and a general hustle that is not typically found in residential-only zones. Residents must weigh these factors when deciding on their ideal living arrangements.

### Regulatory Oversight
The city maintains strict regulations regarding who can reside in non-residential districts to ensure that these areas do not become overly congested with residential developments, which could potentially hinder commercial activities and economic growth. These regulations are enforced through rigorous application processes and periodic reviews by city officials.

This unique arrangement reflects the city’s dynamic and diverse urban structure, accommodating a blend of residential, commercial, and industrial activities seamlessly within its districts. Residents of these areas enjoy the vibrancy and immediacy of city life, contributing to and benefiting from the economic and social exchanges that these districts foster.
