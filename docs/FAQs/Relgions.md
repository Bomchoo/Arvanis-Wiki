## Moral and Ethical Guidance

## Explanation of the Cosmos

Religions explain the origin of the world, the nature of the universe, and the roles of its inhabitants, helping people understand their existence and their place within the universe.

## Social Order and Stability

Religion contributes to social order and stability by defining sacred laws and societal roles, which helps maintain a structured society where each member understands their responsibilities.

## Psychological and Emotional Support

Religion provides psychological comfort and emotional support, offering hope and a sense of purpose during times of crisis or uncertainty through rituals and prayers.

## Political Power and Influence

## Conflict and Cooperation

While religion can be a source of unity and peace, it can also lead to conflict, especially where multiple religions coexist, potentially leading to tensions or wars. Conversely, interfaith dialogues and alliances can promote peace and cooperation.
