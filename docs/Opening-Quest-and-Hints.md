    **As you navigate through the crowded market square, your attention is drawn to an elderly man waving his hands frantically. He’s a peculiar sight amidst the throngs of shoppers and traders—thin, slightly stooped, with a shock of white hair and spectacles perched precariously on his nose. He spots you and hurries over, almost tripping over his own robe in his excitement.**

    **Ivor:**<span class="spoiler-text"> ***Ah! You there! Adventurers, by the looks of it! Just the sort of folk I need. Oh, where are my manners? I'm Ivor, Ivor Hettleweed, scholar, historian, and, well, some say a bit of a mad scientist, but don't you mind that.***</span>

    **Player Character (PC):** <span class="yellow-text">***What do you need from us, Ivor?***</span>

    **Ivor:**<span class="spoiler-text">  ***Ah, straight to the point, excellent, excellent! You see, I've made a rather remarkable discovery, something that could change our understanding of history itself! But I'm getting ahead of myself. I’ve unearthed what I believe to be an artifact of the ancient Juralen civilization—yes, that's right, the Juralen! Thought to be mere myths, phantoms of folklore!***</span>

    **PC:** <span class="yellow-text">***Why come to us with this?***</span>

    **Ivor:**<span class="spoiler-text"> ***Oh, my dear, because such treasures are not just academic curiosities—they're magnets for trouble. And while my mind is sharp as a tack, my old bones aren't quite suited for the... shall we say, 'adventurous' complications that tend to follow such findings. That’s where you come in.***</span>

    **PC:** <span class="yellow-text">***What exactly do you want us to do?***</span>

    **Ivor:**<span class="spoiler-text"> ***Simple, but not easy! I need stout hearts and keen eyes to help protect this artifact. There are others who seek it, but for less scholarly pursuits. I must study it further, understand its secrets, and for that, I need safety, stability—a bit of muscle, perhaps some magic. And of course, I'm willing to pay for your services. What say you? Will you help an old man make the discovery of a lifetime?***</span>

!!! tip "Finding Things To Do"

      **There are plenty of ways to discover things to do in the world! Below are some ideas you can use to help move the story along in various ways! Sometimes, the path less traveled or leaving no stone unturned can be fun!**

## Discovering Events in Doranth

Doranth is a hub of activity where numerous events, both big and small, unfold daily. Whether in the lively town center or the quieter outskirts, opportunities for adventure are plentiful. Knowing who to talk to and where to listen is key to uncovering these stories.

### Tips for Uncovering Events

1. **Visit Local Establishments:**
   Spend time in taverns, inns, and marketplaces. These are the places where news travels fastest. Bartenders, innkeepers, and market vendors often know the latest gossip and can provide information about events that aren't publicly advertised.

   **Hint:** The Golden Tankard tavern is known for attracting adventurers and might have a job board or patrons in need of assistance.

2. **Talk to the Town Crier:**
   The town crier in the main square announces news and events regularly. Listening to his announcements can give you leads on official events, emergencies needing immediate attention, or celebrations where adventurers might showcase their talents.

   **Hint:** Pay attention to any unusual urgency in the crier’s announcements; these often precede major story opportunities.

3. **Check Notice Boards:**
   Notice boards are commonly found near the town hall or at the central crossroads. These boards frequently have requests for help, announcements for tournaments, and notices from those seeking to form new alliances.

   **Hint:** Look for notices that are freshly posted or appear hastily written—these might lead to time-sensitive adventures or crises.

4. **Engage with Local Guilds:**
   Whether it's the adventurers' guild, the merchants' guild, or the mages' guild, each holds a wealth of information and resources. These guilds often have their own agendas and might need discreet help with sensitive issues.

   **Hint:** During guild meetings, members might discuss concerns or missions not mentioned outside their walls—consider offering your services here.

5. **Explore Outskirts and Surrounding Areas:**
   Sometimes, wandering a bit outside the usual paths can lead to unexpected encounters. Travelers, hermits, or those exiled from the town may have unique insights or need help that they cannot seek within the town itself.

   **Hint:** Old ruins or abandoned campsites are often sites of hidden stories or treasures waiting to be discovered.

By keeping your ears open and engaging with the community, you'll find that Doranth is a place brimming with stories waiting to be a part of. Each conversation and exploration can lead to new quests, enriching your adventure in this vibrant world.
