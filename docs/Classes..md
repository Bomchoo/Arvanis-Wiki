# Homebrew Classes - Custom Content

!!! warning "Hard Sell"

    While I'm not 100% against it. You must be able to sell it to me, and it must fit into the lore, and you need to be able to tell me how. I will also need to read it and approve it. I will try to include as much as possible, but I won't be changing the story to fit homebrew content outside of the orignal plot.
